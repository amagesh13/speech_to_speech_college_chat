Billing date : Generated on the 25th day of every month (viewable online the 26th) Due Date : 20th day of the following month For instance, an e-bill generated on August 25th is due the next month on September 20th. Our office does not have the authority to adjust a charge or a credit posted to your account by another department. Questions about specific items on your account should be directed to the originating department. You may locate copies of your most recent and archived eBills: HERE *Viewing a bill after the date it is generated may not give the most up to date account balance. To view the most accurate account activity go to you may access your current account activity: HERE Late Fee Policy Failure to make payment by the specified due date will result in a late fee or finance charge and may jeopardize the student's continued enrollment. Payment in full must be received before the close of business on the due date to avoid a late fee. In the event your account is not settled by the due date, we are required to assess your account with a late payment fee of $10 or 5% of the unpaid balance, whichever is higher. Each month thereafter, a finance charge of 1.5% is assessed to the outstanding balance until your account is paid in full. You may log in at any time to view your billing statements or your current account balance at: View Your Monthly Bill . Students may also obtain a printout of their account or ask questions about their student account by visiting the Financial Service Center. Financial Requirements for Registration All students who register for courses incur a financial obligation to the University. Returning students may not be permitted to register for a subsequent semester until all financial obligations are settled, including current semester fees, parking violations, library fines, medical charges, and other miscellaneous charges. In addition, if you become financially ineligible after completing registration, your registration is held subject to cancellation unless your account is settled by a prescribed date. Students who owe a prior balance and participate in early registration are sent an email notification of their e-bill by Student Financial Services and Cashiering before the start of classes. Payment is due in full by the early scheduled due date. On the other hand, if you register for classes after the notices are sent, you must settle your bill in full immediately or your registration is subject to cancellation. If your registration is canceled you then must re-register and select from classes currently available. Delinquent Accounts Delinquent accounts will be referred to the State of Maryland's Central Collection Unit (CCU). Accounts placed with CCU will be reported to the credit bureau. CCU will assess a minimum collection charge of 17% of the outstanding debt, plus attorney and court fees, if applicable. The university and CCU reserve the right to make changes in fees and other charges as may be deemed necessary. These fees are the student’s responsibility. Debts incurred during each semester must be satisfied before registration can be completed for a subsequent semester. University of Maryland will deny requests for transcripts or diplomas pending clearance of all debts. Any refunds or payments due to students will be applied to existing debts first. Accounts at CCU must be paid at CCU. University of Maryland does not accept payments on CCU accounts. Checks for accounts at CCU must be made payable to CCU. Accounts at CCU can be paid online, by telephone or in person at 300 West Preston Street in Baltimore. For questions regarding your account at CCU, please contact Customer Service at 410-767-1220 or email askccu@dbm.state.md.us or toll free at: 1-888-248-0345. Disputing Your Bill The Buckley Amendment, eﬀective November 1974, prohibits the University from releasing information to anyone other than the student. Written authorization from the student must be provided for other interested parties. A student or parent who wishes to dispute a specific item on a student account must contact the University department that originated the charge to determine the nature of the adjustment, if any, and the appropriateness of the charge. All appeals must be made in writing. Please be aware that late payment fees and finance charges will be assessed on all unpaid balances. It is advised to pay the entire balance due to ensure your account is in good standing while the disputed amount is under appeal. If you do not pay the disputed portion, you must include a request for a waiver of financial penalties in your appeal with the department and forward a copy of the request to the Oﬀice of Student Financial Services and Cashiering. It is your responsibility to file the appeal with the department, forward a copy of the appeal to the Oﬀice of Student Financial Services and Cashiering, and to ensure receipt from both. Please Note: Financial penalties will be incurred on all unpaid balances during the appeal process. If you prevail, a credit of the portion of the financial penalties associated with the amount credited back from the department will be placed on your account. If your appeal is denied, the financial penalties will remain. The portion of your bill not in dispute is subject to financial penalties and is not eligible for waiver of these penalties.

We are open breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. Come in and enjoy anything from the wide range of offerings on the serving lines. Any time we are open, you are welcome — enjoy a meal, come in for a quick snack, or maybe just meet up with your friends. Dining Calendar Resident Dining Plans Connector Dining Plans Every student living on campus in a traditional residence hall participates in the Maryland community by having one of four Resident Dining Plans. These plans provide you with unlimited access to food, seven days a week for the whole semester, while classes are in session and during finals. Our focus will be to serve delicious and popular food while ensuring your health and safety. We will continue to offer a wide variety of food at each meal, modifying the overall plan and our service methods in accordance with best practices this fall. Dining Halls Enter the dining halls by waving your hand through one of the scanners at the front entrance, which provide convenient and secure identity verification. Three dining halls mean that you always have somewhere to go for food – from 7:00 am until 9:00 pm. Visit Yahentamitsi, South Campus Dining Hall and 251 North (Denton). Cafes, Convenience Shops and Food Courts Dining halls provide a wide range of tasty and nutritious food, but we know you’ll want to eat somewhere else now and then. Dining Dollars are set aside funds to use at many locations on campus, including cafes (when academic buildings open), convenience shops and five brand name franchises in two food courts. Dining Dollars can get you fresh carryout on days when you can’t — or prefer not to — eat in a dining hall and are a great way to buy room snacks and supplies. We strongly recommend the upgraded Resident dining plans because they include Dining Dollars. You always buy Dining Dollars at a discount, and you pay no sales tax when you use them. Three upgraded Resident dining plans include Dining Dollars. We recommend the Premium plan to get the best discounts on Dining Dollars.
